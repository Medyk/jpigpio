# jpigpio
A Java interface to the Raspberry Pi pigpio library

Pigpio is a great library for accessing the GPIO pins and other inputs and outputs of a Raspberry Pi.  Pigpio provides interfaces for C and Python.  However, if what you want to do is use the functions of the library from a Java application, you are stuck.  The purpose of this project is to provide a Java interface to the pigpio library.
